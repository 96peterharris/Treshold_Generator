#### **Basic info:**
Homophonic Cipher it is a simple text encryption program created for study purposes.

#### **Information about algorithm:**
The homophonic cipher is a more advanced version of the substitution algorithm in
which for each of the characters from the alphabet, there are substitutes. In this
aplication from the available set of numbers (in this case it is 0-68999), substitutes
are drawn based on the calculated percentage frequency of letters in Polish language.

#### **Limitations:**

  - The input alphabet is limited to the following characters: (A, Ą, B, C, Ć, D,
    E, Ę, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Ń, O, Ó, P, Q, R, S, Ś, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, Ź,
    Ż "SPACE") the size of the letters doesn't matter
  - As part of program security, entering characters not supported by the algorithm
    will disregard them.
